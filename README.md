This assignment is to create two programs;
The first is a large_power program that helps to check if a number in it's power or exponential is large by checking if the power of the number is greater than five thousand
The second is a divisible_by_ten program that checks if a number is divisible by ten by checking if the remainder from division of the number by 10 is equal to zero or not.
